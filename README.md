## Overview
This project is a backend application built using the Go programming language and the Fiber framework. The application follows a microservices architecture, employing JWT authentication with 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication), bcrypt for password hashing, and secure HttpOnly cookies for session management. The backend enables users to perform a variety of actions such as creating and approving routes, managing buy models, registering plans, creating accounts, and logging in securely.

  - Secure password storage using bcrypt.
  - Session management using HttpOnly cookies.
- **Core Functionalities**:
  - User registration and account management.
  - Secure login with optional 2FA.
  - Creation and approval of routes.
  - Management of buy models.
  - Plane registration and updates.
- **Security Features**:
  - Enforced secure practices using bcrypt and HttpOnly cookies.
  - Validation of JWT tokens for API request authorization.
